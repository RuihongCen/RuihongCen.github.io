    Hi! I am a incoming PhD in School of Computing, National University of Singapore!
    Currently my research interest lies in computer graphics, especially in the topic of physically-based simulation. 
    I am curious about the relationship of simulation and geometry representation.

    Before that, I received my M.E. in Nankai University, advised by Prof. Bo Ren. 
    I received my B.E. in South China University of Technology.
